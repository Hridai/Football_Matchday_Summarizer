# Football_Matchday_Summarizer
Pulls scores, scorers and tables (live and past results) via an API. GUI built using TKINTER

# ToDo
- Add Standings when pressing a league button (Possibly with a checkbox? So as not to blast through the free limit of calls to API)
- Add more leagues (Ligue 1? Trivial addition)
- Add scorers by default
- Add times for games in matchweek not yet played
- Add a screenshot of the GUI in this readme
- Format the Matchweek. Add a heading
- Put all of the results in a scrollable list, as it will easily exceed the height of the screen if many scorers, standings incl
